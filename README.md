# Machine-Learning

Worked on the following machine learning projects:
* A Binary Classifier of vertebral column dataset using K-Nearest-Neighbors. 
* A Linear, Multiple, and KNN Regressor to predict the Electrical Energy Output of Combined Cycle Power Plant. 
* A classifier of human activities based on time series obtained by a WirelessSensor Network. 
* A decision tree to determine if a patient has accute inflammation or has accute nephritis based on bodily symptoms. 
* A Lasso and L1 penalized gradient boosting tree for communities and crime dataset. 
* A Random Forest And XGBoost Model Trees for component failure detection in the APS system. 
* A Multi-class and Multi-Label Classification Using Support Vector Machines, K-Means Clustering, and Monte Carlo Simulation for species, genus and family detection of frogs. 
* Supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning methods, designed and evaluated Monte Carlo simulations, active learning strategies, and spectral clustering techniques to analyze performance metrics 
* Designed and implemented a multi-class image classifier for 20 bird species using transfer learning with EfficientNetB0 and VGG16, incorporating data augmentation techniques and fine-tuning the final layers.
