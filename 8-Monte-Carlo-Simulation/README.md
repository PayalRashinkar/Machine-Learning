# Monte-Carlo-Simulation

In this project, we are exploring various machine learning paradigms—supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning—using datasets such as Breast Cancer Wisconsin and Banknote Authentication. The tasks include implementing SVM-based classification, clustering algorithms (k-means and spectral clustering), and active learning strategies to evaluate model performance through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations and learning curves are used to compare the effectiveness of these methods.
